# Part 2
As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.

As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can record more sales
I'd like to create baskets with larger capacity when I need to.

As a member of the public
So that I can maintain my sanity
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.
